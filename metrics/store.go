// Package metrics carries the TEE's instrumentation out of the enclave.
//
// The enclave's own channel is the serial console: about 64 KiB, shared with
// boot messages, kernel output and TLS handshake errors, and exhausted by a few
// hundred instrumented requests. So the TEE also keeps its records behind a
// listener an operator pulls from. The detail is then bounded by a ring in
// memory rather than by the console, and the console window becomes a courtesy
// copy instead of the only one.
//
// What this endpoint serves is internal telemetry: which stage of which request
// took how long, keyed by a random job ID. It carries no user payload, no
// credential and no key material — the TEE's record of a request names the
// provider, the host and the shape of the call, never what was asked or
// answered. That is the boundary the rest of this package lives inside too (see
// tee.TimingRecord), and it is why the endpoint is read-only and
// unauthenticated by design: a deployment restricts it at the network layer, so
// a scraper does not have to be handed a certificate to ask a question whose
// answer has no secrets in it. It listens on loopback unless a deployment says
// otherwise.
