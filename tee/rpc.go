// The Hub↔TEE interface is a single RPC: POST /v1/execute carrying a canonical
// ExecuteRequest, answered by an SSE stream with three kinds of frame in a
// fixed order:
//
//  1. 响应开始 — event: start, one frame carrying the upstream status code and
//     the allowlisted response headers (see ForwardResponseHeaders), emitted
//     before any chunk. This is what lets the Hub decide how to handle the
//     stream before its first byte: a 200 with text/event-stream is relayed
//     as a stream, a 401 or 429 is surfaced as the error it is.
//  2. 响应片段 — data: frames carrying the raw response body, unchanged. The
//     receipt's stream hash commits to exactly these bytes.
//  3. 执行结束 — event: receipt, the signed proof of the exchange. The receipt
//     binds all three parts: the status (StatusCode), the forwarded headers
//     (ResponseHeadersHash), and the body (StreamHash).
//
// Everything else — pricing, quota, scheduling — lives on the Hub side of
// this seam.

//   - The conventional single space after `data:` is always emitted, and the
//     reader strips exactly one, so a chunk that itself begins with spaces
//     survives. Only leading whitespace is conventional; trailing whitespace is
//     payload and must not be trimmed, which is why this does not use a
//     general trim.
