"""Cross-host launch: an ordinary host (Hub/agent/mockprovider) + a real SEV-SNP
confidential instance running the real `tee` binary under the two-tier loader.

The confidential instance has no sshd. Its runtime config is injected by the
loader from EC2 user-data, so this script encodes it as KEY=VAL lines:

    TOKENHIVE_SIM_DIR=/tmp/tee        writable state dir (loader mounts /tmp 0777)
    TEE_ADDR=0.0.0.0:18090            mTLS request plane the Hub dials
    TEE_RELAY=ws://<host-ip>:18085/v1/relay    reverse tunnel back to the Hub
    TEE_RELAY_KEY=<relay-key>          Hub TeeRelay authentication (shared with
                                       crosshost.sh's -relay-key)
    TEE_PLATFORM=sevsnp               real attestation (fail-fast off SNP)
    TEE_MTLS=1                         RA-TLS + demand a Hub client cert
    TEE_MTLS_CLIENT_CA=/run/bundle/mtls/hub-ca.pem

The confidential instance also carries an IAM instance profile when
TOKENHIVE_TEE_INSTANCE_PROFILE names one. That profile is what lets the TEE's
structured logger authenticate to CloudWatch Logs on AWS; with none, the TEE
still runs but has only its serial console to speak through, and a console is
a few minutes deep. The profile is bound at RunInstances, so it is an input to
launching rather than something a later call can add.

Both instances share one VPC/subnet/SG. The SG additionally permits the
cross-host ports (18085 hub relay, 18090 tee) between its own members
(source = the SG itself), so they reach each other regardless of public IP.

    TOKENHIVE_TEE_INSTANCE_PROFILE=<name> \
    python3 crosshost.py <snp-ami-id> [--host-ip <hub-public-ip>]
                          [--single] [--tee-only] [--new] [--dry-run]
Writes crosshost.json {host:{...}, tee:{...}, superseded:[...]} and never
deletes anything. Refuses to run without TOKENHIVE_USER.

--single launches ONLY the confidential tee, running the whole loop (tee + Hub +
agent + mockprovider) inside that one instance through the supervisor bundle
(TOKENHIVE_BUILD_SINGLE=1); no ordinary host is started.

--tee-only launches ONLY the confidential tee from the cross-host bundle (its
./app is the real `tee` binary, not the supervisor) and starts no ordinary host.
The tee still needs a Hub TeeRelay URL in TEE_RELAY, but with no Hub there is
nothing to dial — the relay connection is lazy (dialed only when a provider
connection is needed), so a placeholder is harmless at boot. Pass --host-ip to
aim TEE_RELAY at a real Hub instead of the placeholder.

--new launches a fresh confidential instance even when a live one is recorded,
WITHOUT terminating the recorded one: the old record is moved to
`superseded` in crosshost.json and the old instance keeps running. That is what
makes a swap not block on instance termination — bring the new tee up, repoint
the Hub at it, and retire the old one afterwards with `crosshost.sh down
--superseded` (see retire.py). The reciprocal invariant is the important half:
this script never terminates an instance on any path, so no `up` can destroy the
machine it is replacing.
