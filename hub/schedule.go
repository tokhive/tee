// providersForModel returns the providers the Hub can route a model to, ordered
// by their effective book price for it (ascending), with ties broken by provider
// name so the order is a pure function of supply and price.
//
// The Hub only routes new work to a provider whose agent is online right now —
// a provider nobody currently egresses for cannot carry traffic, so it is not a
// candidate. A Hub that does not host agent registration at all (no agent
// secret configured: the embedded business tests driving a scripted TEE)
// schedules over the static market table instead, where every listed provider
// is treated as supply.
//
// The distinction matters on disconnect: an agent that goes offline takes its
// listing with it, and its provider stops being a candidate at any price — not
// even the platform default. Falling back to the market table whenever no agent
// happened to be online would keep routing jobs to a tunnel nobody is holding.
//
// An agent may additionally declare which models its upstream can serve (see
// AgentRegister.Models). That declaration is a soft capability hint, not a
// gate: an agent that declared nothing serves any model and stays a candidate;
// an agent that declared a list the requested model is not in is skipped, since
// sending it the job would only buy an upstream refusal. When the model is in
// no online agent's list at all, the request is refused with
// ErrNoProviderForModel rather than fired at every provider hoping one answers.
//
// The effective book price is per-request plus any per-model surcharge plus a
// floor of one mebibyte of the volume rate, taken from the agent's own card
// when it declared one and the platform default otherwise. Volume pricing is
// deliberately left out of the *forecast* — the Hub cannot know how large a
// response will be before it runs the job, so an order that depended on the
// final size would be non-deterministic. The floor is not a forecast: billing
// rounds volume up to whole mebibytes, so the smallest non-empty exchange
// already bills one unit of the volume rate. Folding that floor in is what
// keeps a seller from hiding its cost behind a zero per-request price (see
// bookPrice).
//
// An unlisted model pays no premium under a rate card, so every candidate is
// still priced. The card's numbers, not the Hub's opinion, decide the order.

// The volume floor is deliberate and load-bearing. A scheduler keyed on the
// per-request rate alone can be gamed: a seller advertises a zero (or trivial)
// per-request price, hides an enormous per-megabyte rate behind it, wins every
// auction on the headline number, and only then does the buyer discover the
// bill. Billing rounds volume up to whole mebibytes, so the smallest non-empty
// exchange already bills one unit of the volume rate; folding exactly that
// floor into the book price puts the volume rate back into the number the
// scheduler orders by and the number the buyer is shown. A card that charges a
// lot per megabyte then looks expensive where the choice is made. It is a
// floor, not a forecast — the charge itself still comes from Price over the
// bytes actually delivered — so it can only ever make a provider look *more*
// expensive than a real tiny job would be, never less. Understating a price is
// the vulnerability; overstating it is merely conservative.

// response — a stream no client could parse and no receipt would cover — and
