// epochConnections retires the connections a rotation leaves behind.
//
// A rotation replaces the key this process signs receipts with, but it does not
// replace the certificate an already-established TLS connection presented: that
// was fixed at its handshake. A verifier that binds a receipt to the connection
// that carried it — which is the whole point of RA-TLS, and what the Hub does —
// then sees a receipt naming the rotated key arrive over a certificate carrying
// the previous one, and is right to refuse the pair. Nothing is wrong with
// either half; they simply belong to different epochs.
//
// The connection is the part that can be retired, so it is, in two steps that
// cover each other:
//
//   - accept stamps every connection with the epoch it was accepted under, and
//     guard refuses a request that arrives under a later one. This is the part
//     that has to be per request rather than per connection: an HTTP/2
//     connection can start a new stream while an old one still holds it active,
//     and a peer can put a request on an idle connection in the instant between
//     a rotation and the close below.
//   - track closes those connections — at the rotation if they are idle, and
//     otherwise the moment they fall idle — so the refusal above stays a
//     backstop rather than something a peer meets on the normal path.
//
// A request already in flight when the rotation lands is a different case and
// is handled in the service, which pins the signer an execution started under
// (see Service.perform) so the receipt matches the certificate it is answering
// over. Cutting such a request here would turn an answer this process is still
// able to produce correctly into a failure.
type epochConnections struct {

// the peer a reconnect rather than a request it was charged for.
//
// The 503 carries tee.EpochRetiredHeader so the Hub can tell this refusal from
// any other 503 and retry it on a fresh connection. Without the marker a Hub
// could only guess, and guessing wrong is expensive: retrying a refusal the
// service had already acted on would execute — and bill — the same job twice.

// this handler has run for that request.
