// ReadHeaderTimeout alone does not cover this: it stops a client that stalls in
// the headers, but a client that sends headers promptly and then dribbles (or
// never sends) the body it announced with Content-Length keeps a connection and
// its goroutine for as long as it likes. The 16 MiB body cap bounds how much can
// arrive, not how slowly.
//
// It is safe to set server-wide precisely because it bounds *reading the
// request* and nothing else. The stdlib clears the read deadline once the body
// is consumed (and on hijack, which is how the agent gate and the tee relay take
// the connection), so a response that streams for minutes — every SSE answer —
// is untouched; it is WriteTimeout, deliberately left zero, that would cut such
